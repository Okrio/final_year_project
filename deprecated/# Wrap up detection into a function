# Wrap up detection into a function 
- Input: Tstart and Tend 
- Makes log of position every interval 
- Output: Vector of timestamps and positions of the speaker 
(Can plot position against timestamp and see if there's movement)

- Best current estimate 
- Smooth the estimate position 

# Tracking (Good add on)
- Instantaneous estimates of a quantity 
- Dynamic model - is the thing stationary or moving? 
- Even if missing in one frame - can still know its i.e moving left 
(Potential for continuous calibration)

Step 1: 
Function getPosition: Get 1 frame with position
Output: If detected, return result; 
		else, return NULL 


Simple: 
- getPosition

Advanced: 
- Start tracking 
- Stop tracking 

Complex: (Look at trackers - Kalman Filter)
- Start tracking
- getPositionNow
- Stop tracking
