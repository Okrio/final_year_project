# Final Year Project Repository 
# Tasks: 
Phase 1: 
1. ~~Set up relevant environments~~ (Autumn Term, Week 3)
2. ~~Set up version control environment (Git)~~ (Autumn Term, Week 3) 
3. ~~Isolate coloured dots in OpenCV~~ (Autumn Term, Week 3) 
4. ~~Track coloured dots using contours~~ (Autumn Term, Week 4) 
5. Determine pixel size 
6. Map pixel size to relative distance from camera 
7. Determine pixel location of contours

Need to figure out a way to account for angle problems with the circles! 
Use a reference contour and compare the area to the area obtained by minenclosingcircle to zero the program? 
Will use a square instead to detect out targets and determine if they are in the correct aspect ratio! Then you can estimate whether the camera is looking at them straight, or how the degree of change is like!
