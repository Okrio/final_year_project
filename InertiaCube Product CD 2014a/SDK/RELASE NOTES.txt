InterSense Library version 4.2401
Relase Notes
   File last updated: 2014-05-22


WHAT'S NEW (library and sample applications):
Version 4.2401
==============
* AHRS support for embedded applications
	- Requires firmware version 4.2 or above (contact InterSense to obtain
	  this if required; all IC4 products may be upgraded to this version)
	- Maximum data rate of 200 Hz is allowed
	- If multiple outputs are requested, it may not be possible to achieve
	  200 Hz due to timing considerations
		- It is recommended to use the Cbn, Euler angle, or quaternion
		  representations, by themselves
	- AHRS data can be visualized using any DLL based application (including
	  ISDemo) by creating a file in the application's directory called
	  isense1.ini (the '1' is the device number, so a second IC4 would be
	  configured using the isense2.ini file, and so on), containing:

	  #STATION
	  GetAHRSData = 1

	  Or by calling ISD_GetStationConfig(), setting 
	  ISD_STATION_INFO_TYPE.GetAHRSData to 1 and calling
	  ISD_SetStationConfig(), which accomplishes the same thing.  This allows
	  for easy testing of how the AHRS data would look without requiring any
	  code to be written.  Actual embedded use of the AHRS data is generally
	  expected to be performed using code written against the IC4 Interface
	  Control Document (ICD).
* Improvements to ismain example application (1.0.9)
	- Ability to reduce logged data rate via '[' key, to allow long term
	  logging with small file size
	- Ability to display temperature (for supported InertiaCube sensors)
	  via the 'm' key
* Fixed reception of UDP packets for InertiaCube4 sensors
* Fixed incorrect initial yaw reported by IC2+/IC4 sensors if DLL started
    with compass disabled
* Fixed incorrect handling of the isports.ini file (previously the DLL would
    try to detect serial ports that were not the ones specified, e.g. always
	test COM1 for Port1=..., even if Port1=COM35, for example)
* Fixed incorrect read-back of Prediction value on 32-bit Linux (could be off
    by one for certain values)
* Improved Bluetooth connectivity (KeepAlives implemented for IC4 FW 5, and
    improved Bluetooth recovery code when Bluetooth is used along with other
	sensors)


Version 4.2381
==============
* Support of InertiaCube4 (IC4) sensor (USB, serial, and Bluetooth models)
* Voltage and temperature outputs are available for this sensor through the DLL


Version 4.237
==============
* Support of 900 MHz radios on IS-900 SimTracker and VETracker.  
* DLL provides timestamps in the log file.
* ISENSEX_INI_DIR is searched before other directories for the isenseX.ini
  files.
* Added additional directory checks for isenseX.ini files (C:\dev 
  [UNIX: /dev] and C:\ [UNIX: /]), in addition to current directory.
* DLL/shared library now parses the last line of isenseX.ini files.
* Data is no longer 'buffered' when calling ISD_GetTrackingData() slowly for
  UDP data.
* UDP extended data now provides timestamps.
* DLL can connect to UDP broadcasts from multiple applications on a single PC.
* DLL now reports angles properly if an IS-900 has been manually configured to 
  output quaternion data.
* ISD_OpenTracker() no longer scans additional ports when a specific port is
  specified



Version 4.2110
==============
* Supports IS-900 PCI Tracker with wired/wireless sensors (product will 
  NOT work with DLL versions below 4.2100).  Only Windows is supported.


Version 4.2100
==============
* Supports initial release of IS-900 PCI Tracker (product will NOT work with
  previous DLL versions).  Only Windows and wired trackers are supported.


Version 4.19
==============
* Bluetooth support; adding ":bluetooth" to entries in the isports.ini file
  will enable specific support and optimizations for use of Bluetooth
  trackers such as the InertiaCube BT.
* Trackers descriptor and calibration files are now cached to disk to improve
  detection time; will be most helpful when using InertiaCube BT sensors, as
  well as other configurations such as TCP serial port emulation software (not 
  officially supported by InterSense).
* A new sample application (VC++ 2005, Linux, and OS X) demonstrates display
  and logging of data from multiple trackers and stations, using the library.
 
Known Issues (4.19):
  * NOTE: All listed issues in this release pertain SPECIFICALLY to Bluetooth
    functionality.
  * Mac OS X may be very slow to open multiple trackers (as slow as 40 seconds per
    tracker), when using the built-in adapter.  Subsequent attempts should be faster
	due to caching of descriptor/calibration files.  InterSense did test a number of
	external Bluetooth adapters on OS X, and these did not exhibit this problem.
  * The maximum number of sensors depends on distance, level of wireless
    interference, and adapter class.  Some adapters can reliably open more
    sensors than others.  Most can open 4 sensors reliably, some may be able to
    open as many as 7.  
  * Class 1 adapter range is approximately 30m maximum, and class 2 range is 
    approximately 3m maximum.  Data may be lost at the range limits. Some adapters
	may work well with one operating system but not with another due to driver
	limitations.
  * Communications that have been lost (typically due to going out of range) are
    not recovered and the workaround would need to manually detect this condition 
	and resolve it by closing and reopening the tracker.  InterSense anticipates
	automatically handling this recovery in a future release.


Version 4.17
==============
* MacOS X support - Currently tested on OS X 10.6.3, Intel, but 
  expected to work on PPC hardware as well as versions >= 10.4.  The
  dylib contains 32 and 64-bit Intel, and 32-bit PPC versions.

* Increased detection speed; the library now performs a full check on 
  all COM ports at 115200 baud, rather than just the first 4; for
  other data rates (on processors only; does not apply to serial 
  devices like IC2/IC2+/IC3) it is necessary to specify the baud rate
  manually in isports.ini.

* Various environment variable checks added:
  * ISPORTS_INI_DIR is searched before other directories for the isports.ini file
  * IS_NOSMEM suppresses searching for shared memory on Windows
  * IS_DETECTITRAX allows the library to search for InterTrax devices
  * IS_NOLOG suppresses creation of the isense.log file

* Linux data rate issues fixed with IS-900 (previous versions of the library
   may not put it into continuous mode, resulting in low data rate).

* UNIX data rate issue with wireless IC3 receivers fixed.

* UNIX builds can recover devices when an application is killed with CTRL-C.

* The isense.h file now includes version information to make it easier to
  verify the correct header file is being used with a given library version.
